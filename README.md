# ExpandingView
A simple animated UIView written in **Swift**, which expands to fullscreen when tapped and closes on a swipe down gesture.

*Usage in Storyboards is supported!*

## UIView Inheritance

Want to use this on something else rather than a `UIView`? You change the super class to anything which inherits from `UIView`, such as `UIImageView`.
